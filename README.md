# Kings Game

This project was created to demonstrate a simply game built with Angular.

## How it works

The user manual is super easy, you just need to click on the "Next Card" botton to draw the card. 

## Getting started

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use NPM to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. Run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
